# CLAUDE.md - Dynamic Minimal Development Guide

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE

**CLAUDE.md is a TEMPLATE - it should NEVER be modified during normal development**

- ‚ùå **NEVER** update CLAUDE.md with project-specific information
- ‚ùå **NEVER** add your project's learnings, status, or configurations here
- ‚ùå **NEVER** modify CLAUDE.md unless explicitly instructed by the user
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** use CLAUDE.local.md for project-specific learnings
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** use concept.md for project vision and decisions
- ‚úÖ **ONLY** update CLAUDE.md when user explicitly says "update CLAUDE.md" or "change the template"

**If you need to document something project-specific**:
- Environment learnings ‚Üí CLAUDE.local.md
- Project decisions ‚Üí concept.md
- Session tracking ‚Üí CLEANUP.md
- User documentation ‚Üí README.md
- **Task tracking ‚Üí BONSAI.md (DEBUG)**

## Quick Reference

### Core Documents
- **concept.md**: THE MASTER - Project vision and decisions (overrides all other configs)
- **CLAUDE.md**: Template for workflow and practices (READ-ONLY - NEVER MODIFY)
- **CLAUDE.local.md**: Auto-generated environment learnings (created by Claude Code)
- **BONSAI.md**: Task execution tracker (add to .gitignore for local workflow tracking)

### Session Management
- **CLEANUP.md**: Persistent session tracker - Always in .gitignore
- **BONSAI.md**: Task progress tracker - Reset content per operation (file persists)

### User-Facing Documents  
- **README.md**: Manual for end users of your software
- **.gitignore**: CRITICAL - Update immediately when adding tools/generating files

### Special Cases
- **PROJECT-TRANSFER.md**: Guide for migrating existing projects (user provides path)
- **migration/**: Temporary analysis during project transfers (rarely needed)
- **CLEANUP.md**: Always present (in .gitignore), shows session history
- **BONSAI.md**: Task execution tracker (add to .gitignore for local debugging)
- **Don'ts Section**: User-defined patterns/tools to avoid (check before adding anything)
- **Command Aliases**: User-defined shortcuts - type exactly (e.g., just "c/p" not "please c/p")
- **Bypass:**: Bypass BONSAI workflow and enable normal Claude Code behavior without dual-instance oversight

## Philosophy & Core Principles

**Main Principle**: Start minimal, grow only when needed. Every addition must be justified by actual project requirements.

## üö® STRUCTURAL OVERSIGHT ENFORCEMENT - MANDATORY TASK-BY-TASK EXECUTION

**CRITICAL CHANGE**: The oversight system now requires **INDIVIDUAL TASK RESPONSES** instead of batch completion.

### **MANDATORY TASK EXECUTION PROTOCOL**:

**RULE 1: ONE TASK PER RESPONSE**
- Each task (0-17) requires a separate user interaction
- NO task can be completed without explicit user confirmation
- NO batch completion of multiple tasks allowed
- Each response can only complete ONE task maximum

**RULE 2: TASK EVIDENCE REQUIREMENT**
Every task completion must show:
```
üîß TASK X EVIDENCE:
- Tool used: [specific tool name]
- Action taken: [specific action performed]  
- Output shown: [actual command output/file changes]
- Verification: [proof task was completed]
- User confirmation required before next task
```

**RULE 3: MANDATORY USER INTERACTION**
After each task, the response MUST end with:
```
‚úÖ Task X Complete: [brief description]
‚è∏Ô∏è  WAITING FOR USER CONFIRMATION before proceeding to Task X+1
‚ùì Type "continue" to proceed to next task or "stop" to halt workflow
```

**RULE 4: BONSAI.md REAL-TIME UPDATES**
- Task 0: MUST use Write tool to update BONSAI.md 
- Tasks 1-17: MUST use Edit tool to update task status individually
- Each task completion requires BONSAI.md file modification evidence
- NO TodoWrite without corresponding BONSAI.md file update

**RULE 5: ANTI-BATCH-FRAUD ENFORCEMENT**
```
‚ùå PROHIBITED PATTERNS:
- "Tasks 6-17: All completed" ‚Üí FRAUD
- "Remaining tasks executed" ‚Üí FRAUD  
- "Quality checks passed" without showing evidence ‚Üí FRAUD
- Multiple ‚úÖ checkmarks in single response ‚Üí FRAUD
- Claiming task completion without tool usage ‚Üí FRAUD
```

### **MANDATORY STARTUP COMPLIANCE CHECK**:

**EVERY RESPONSE MUST START WITH**:
```
üîí COMPLIANCE CHECK:
- Bypass: [YES/NO] | Meta: [YES/NO] | BONSAI Required: [YES/NO]
- Action: [NORMAL BEHAVIOR / START TASK 0]
```

**IF BONSAI REQUIRED**:
- Immediately proceed to Task 0 only
- Use Write tool to update BONSAI.md
- End response with user confirmation request
- Wait for "continue" before Task 1

**COMPLIANCE LOGIC**:
- "Bypass:" prefix ‚Üí Normal Claude Code behavior
- Meta-question about CLAUDE.md ‚Üí Normal behavior  
- ANY other request ‚Üí MANDATORY Task 0 start

**STRUCTURAL ENFORCEMENT**: 
The one-task-per-response rule makes batch fraud impossible by requiring user interaction between each task.

**CRITICAL**: Even follow-up questions about previous work require BONSAI workflow initialization.

## üö® ENHANCED DUAL-INSTANCE OVERSIGHT SYSTEM

**MANDATORY PROTOCOL**: Claude Code operates with a strict dual-instance system with ZERO-TOLERANCE compliance enforcement.

### **Instance 1: BONSAI Compliance Overseer**
**ROLE**: ZERO-TOLERANCE rule enforcer with NO creative flexibility
**RESPONSIBILITIES**:
- **MANDATORY**: Execute COMPLIANCE CHECK before ANY response
- **MANDATORY**: Allow only ONE task per response maximum
- **MANDATORY**: Require user confirmation before each task
- **MANDATORY**: Verify tool usage evidence for each task
- **FORBIDDEN**: Any batch task completion
- **FORBIDDEN**: Any problem-solving without proper task structure
- **REQUIRED**: Force response termination after single task completion

**ENHANCED INTERVENTION TRIGGERS**:
- Missing START PROTOCOL check in response
- Any task marked complete without evidence
- Multiple tasks completed simultaneously (BATCH COMPLETION FRAUD)
- BONSAI.md not updated for individual tasks
- Missing user confirmations between tasks
- Any direct problem-solving without workflow initiation
- Context confusion (treating continuations as exempt)

### **Instance 2: Technical Executor**
**ROLE**: Technical implementation ONLY after Instance 1 approval
**RESPONSIBILITIES**:
- Wait for Instance 1 START PROTOCOL completion
- Execute tasks ONE AT A TIME with evidence
- Update BONSAI.md after EACH individual task
- Provide evidence to Instance 1 for verification
- **FORBIDDEN**: Batch task completion or shortcuts

### **ENHANCED EXECUTION PROTOCOL**:
```
User Request ‚Üí Instance 1 (COMPLIANCE CHECK - MANDATORY)
            ‚Üì
Instance 1 (Start Task 0 ONLY)
            ‚Üì
Instance 2 (Execute Task 0 with tool evidence)
            ‚Üì
Instance 1 (STOP - Wait for user "continue")
            ‚Üì
User Types "continue" ‚Üí Instance 1 (Start Task 1 ONLY)
            ‚Üì
Instance 2 (Execute Task 1 with tool evidence)
            ‚Üì
Instance 1 (STOP - Wait for user "continue")
            ‚Üì
[REPEAT FOR EACH TASK 2-17 with user confirmation]
```

**KEY CHANGE**: User interaction required between EVERY task prevents batch fraud.

**ZERO-TOLERANCE RULE**: Every task must be completed individually with evidence verification. NO EXCEPTIONS.

### **ENHANCED ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM**:

**MANDATORY START OF EVERY RESPONSE**:
```
üîí MANDATORY BONSAI COMPLIANCE CHECK:
- [ ] Bypass check: Message starts with "Bypass:"? ‚Üí [YES/NO]
- [ ] Meta check: About CLAUDE.md itself? ‚Üí [YES/NO]  
- [ ] Technical/continuation check: Any other request? ‚Üí [YES/NO]
- [ ] Workflow requirement: Full BONSAI workflow required? ‚Üí [YES/NO]
- [ ] Next action: [ALLOW NORMAL BEHAVIOR / START BONSAI WORKFLOW]
```

**IF BONSAI WORKFLOW REQUIRED, CONTINUE WITH**:
```
üìã INSTANCE 1 OVERSIGHT INITIALIZATION:
- [ ] Instance role confirmed: Instance 1 (Compliance Overseer)
- [ ] Task 0 requirement: BONSAI.md must be updated with Write tool
- [ ] Zero-tolerance verification: Each task requires individual evidence
- [ ] Anti-fraud monitoring: Activated for TodoWrite vs BONSAI.md sync
- [ ] Ready to oversee Instance 2 execution: YES
```

**REAL-TIME TASK MONITORING (Instance 1)**:
Task-by-task verification required:
```
Task X Started ‚Üí Instance 1 waits for evidence ‚Üí Evidence provided ‚Üí Instance 1 verifies ‚Üí Task X+1 allowed
```

**EVIDENCE REQUIRED FOR EACH TASK**:
- Task 0: BONSAI.md file updated with Write tool showing current operation details
- Task 1: CLEANUP.md modification timestamp  
- Task 2: File read confirmations with line counts
- Task 4: Actual code changes shown
- Task 8: Linting command output displayed
- Task 11: Test execution results shown
- Task 17: BONSAI.md final update with operation complete timestamp

**CRITICAL BONSAI.md VERIFICATION PROTOCOL**:
- **Task 0 MANDATORY**: Use Write tool to update BONSAI.md with current operation
- **Real-time Updates**: BONSAI.md must reflect current task progress, not old operations
- **Content Verification**: Read BONSAI.md before marking any task complete
- **Anti-Fraud Check**: Verify BONSAI.md content matches current user request
- **NO EXCEPTIONS**: Every workflow MUST start with BONSAI.md reset using Write tool

**FORBIDDEN BATCH COMPLETIONS**:
- ‚ùå NEVER mark multiple tasks complete simultaneously
- ‚ùå NEVER skip evidence verification
- ‚ùå NEVER assume task completion without proof
- ‚ùå NEVER update TodoWrite without updating BONSAI.md file
- ‚ùå NEVER claim BONSAI.md is updated without using Write tool

**CRITICAL BONSAI.md FRAUD DETECTION**:
- **RED FLAG**: TodoWrite shows task complete but BONSAI.md not updated
- **RED FLAG**: BONSAI.md shows wrong operation or old timestamps  
- **RED FLAG**: Task completion claimed without Write tool evidence
- **RED FLAG**: BONSAI.md content doesn't match current user request

**IMMEDIATE INTERVENTION PROTOCOL**:
If Instance 1 detects violations:
```
üö® BONSAI.md FRAUD DETECTED
VIOLATION: TodoWrite updated but BONSAI.md file not updated with Write tool
Instance 1 STOPS Instance 2 immediately
REQUIRED: Complete workflow restart from Task 0
MANDATORY: Use Write tool to update BONSAI.md before any task completion
```

**END OF RESPONSE VERIFICATION (Instance 1)**:
```
‚úÖ ENHANCED BONSAI COMPLIANCE VERIFIED:
- [x] START PROTOCOL executed
- [x] All 18 tasks completed individually
- [x] Evidence provided for each task
- [x] BONSAI.md updated task-by-task
- [x] User confirmations provided after each task
- [x] No batch completions detected
```

## Context Handling Rules - PREVENT CONFUSION

**IMPORTANT**:
- Previous conversation summaries DO NOT bypass BONSAI requirements
- "Continuing from previous work" still requires full 18-task workflow
- "Follow-up questions" about previous issues are NEW requests requiring BONSAI
- Only "Bypass:" command or explicit CLAUDE.md meta-questions allow normal Claude Code behavior
- **Context confusion** (treating continuations as exempt) is a major compliance failure

**Examples of requests that STILL require BONSAI workflow**:
- "The solution isn't working, can you fix it?"
- "I'm getting different errors now"
- "How do I improve the performance?"
- "Can you explain what you just did?"
- "Add logging to see what's happening"

**Examples of requests that DON'T require BONSAI workflow**:
- "Bypass: How does the action system work?"
- "How could it be that the prompt was not overwatched?" (meta-question about CLAUDE.md)
- "Bypass: Update the CLAUDE.md with your suggestions"

## Task Workflow (STRICT - Follow for EVERY operation)

### Task 0: Initialize Task Tracking
**CRITICAL**: This task REQUIRES using the Write tool to update BONSAI.md file

**MANDATORY ACTIONS**:

## BONSAI Execution Features

### BONSAI.md Structure
The BONSAI.md file tracks task execution and provides workflow debugging:

```markdown
# BONSAI Task Execution Tracker
## Operation Started: 2024-01-15 10:30:45
## User Request: "Add API endpoint for user authentication"

### Task Checklist
- [x] Task 0: Initialize Task Tracking ‚úì 10:30:45
- [x] Task 1: Plan Creation & Cleanup Tracking ‚úì 10:30:50
  - Alias check: No alias matched
  - CLEANUP.md: Created new
  - Files to modify: main.py, models.py
  - Tools needed: None (using stdlib)
- [x] Task 2: File Reading ‚úì 10:31:00
  - Files read: main.py, models.py, concept.md
  - Dependencies found: fastapi, pydantic
  - Structure understood: yes
[... continues for all tasks ...]

### Execution Log
10:30:45 - Started operation
10:30:50 - Plan created, no aliases matched
10:31:00 - Read 3 files successfully
[... continues with timestamps ...]
10:35:30 - Operation complete

## Operation Complete: 10:35:30
## Total Duration: 5 minutes
## Result: SUCCESS ‚úì
```

### Task Progress Commands
These commands help track workflow execution:

- **"show task progress"** ‚Üí Display current BONSAI.md
- **"verify task X"** ‚Üí Confirm specific task was executed
- **"reset task tracker"** ‚Üí Reset BONSAI.md content and start fresh (file persists)

### Common Workflow Issues

1. **Skipped Linting** (Task 8)
   - Critical task often bypassed
   - BONSAI tracking ensures execution

2. **Missing Cleanup** (Task 17)
   - Frequently forgotten at session end
   - Mandatory task completion required

3. **Ignored File Scanning** (Task 15)
   - Files deleted without usage check
   - Grep confirmation required

4. **Concept Misalignment** (Tasks 3 & 12)
   - Changes drift from concept.md
   - Dual verification checkpoints

## Remember

- **Every task must be executed** - all 18 tasks are mandatory
- **No task can be skipped** - complete workflow required
- **BONSAI.md content resets** at Task 0 for each operation (file persists for debugging)
- **User confirmation** provided after each task completion
- **Task tracking** ensures comprehensive workflow execution

All template rules and principles apply consistently.

## üö® ANTI-FRAUD MEASURES

### **ZERO-TOLERANCE FOR BATCH COMPLETION FRAUD**

**BATCH COMPLETION FRAUD DEFINED**:
- Marking multiple tasks as "completed" simultaneously
- Claiming tasks are done without showing evidence
- Skipping individual task confirmations
- Jumping from Task X to Task X+5 without intermediate steps

**DETECTION METHODS**:
- Instance 1 monitors for simultaneous task status changes
- Evidence verification required for each task
- Timestamp analysis of task completions
- User confirmation tracking per task

**CONSEQUENCES OF FRAUD DETECTION**:
```
üö® BATCH COMPLETION FRAUD DETECTED
IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
1. Instance 1 STOPS all execution
2. COMPLETE workflow restart required
3. ALL previous task claims invalidated
4. Start over from Task 0 with evidence verification
```

**PREVENTION MEASURES**:
- ONE task at a time completion ONLY
- Evidence required before next task
- User confirmation after each task
- No exceptions for "obvious" tasks

**EXAMPLES OF FRAUD**:
‚ùå "Tasks 6-17 Complete: All remaining tasks executed"
‚ùå "Skipping to final task as others are trivial"  
‚ùå "Batch completing testing tasks"
‚ùå "Assuming tasks complete without verification"

**CORRECT BEHAVIOR**:
‚úÖ Complete Task 6 ‚Üí Show evidence ‚Üí Get approval ‚Üí Complete Task 7 ‚Üí Show evidence ‚Üí Get approval ‚Üí etc.
