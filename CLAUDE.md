# CLAUDE.md - Dynamic Minimal Development Guide

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE

**CLAUDE.md is a TEMPLATE - it should NEVER be modified during normal development**

- ❌ **NEVER** update CLAUDE.md with project-specific information
- ❌ **NEVER** add your project's learnings, status, or configurations here
- ❌ **NEVER** modify CLAUDE.md unless explicitly instructed by the user
- ✅ **ALWAYS** use CLAUDE.local.md for project-specific learnings
- ✅ **ALWAYS** use concept.md for project vision and decisions
- ✅ **ONLY** update CLAUDE.md when user explicitly says "update CLAUDE.md" or "change the template"

**If you need to document something project-specific**:
- Environment learnings → CLAUDE.local.md
- Project decisions → concept.md
- Session tracking → CLEANUP.md
- User documentation → README.md
- **Task tracking → BONSAI.md (DEBUG)**

## Quick Reference

### Core Documents
- **concept.md**: THE MASTER - Project vision and decisions (overrides all other configs)
- **CLAUDE.md**: Template for workflow and practices (READ-ONLY - NEVER MODIFY)
- **CLAUDE.local.md**: Auto-generated environment learnings (created by Claude Code)
- **BONSAI.md**: Task execution tracker (add to .gitignore for local workflow tracking)

### Session Management
- **CLEANUP.md**: Persistent session tracker - Always in .gitignore
- **BONSAI.md**: Task progress tracker - Reset content per operation (file persists)

### User-Facing Documents  
- **README.md**: Manual for end users of your software
- **.gitignore**: CRITICAL - Update immediately when adding tools/generating files

### Special Cases
- **PROJECT-TRANSFER.md**: Guide for migrating existing projects (user provides path)
- **migration/**: Temporary analysis during project transfers (rarely needed)
- **CLEANUP.md**: Always present (in .gitignore), shows session history
- **BONSAI.md**: Task execution tracker (add to .gitignore for local debugging)
- **Don'ts Section**: User-defined patterns/tools to avoid (check before adding anything)
- **Command Aliases**: User-defined shortcuts - type exactly (e.g., just "c/p" not "please c/p")
- **Bypass:**: Bypass BONSAI workflow and enable normal Claude Code behavior without dual-instance oversight

## Philosophy & Core Principles

**Main Principle**: Start minimal, grow only when needed. Every addition must be justified by actual project requirements.

## 🚨 STRUCTURAL OVERSIGHT ENFORCEMENT - MANDATORY TASK-BY-TASK EXECUTION

**CRITICAL CHANGE**: The oversight system now requires **INDIVIDUAL TASK EXECUTION** instead of batch completion.

### **MANDATORY TASK EXECUTION PROTOCOL**:

**RULE 1: CONTINUOUS SINGLE-TASK EXECUTION**
- Execute all tasks (0-17) in a continuous workflow
- NO batch completion of multiple tasks allowed
- Process one task at a time with automatic progression
- NO stopping between tasks - complete workflow runs from Task 0 through Task 17 automatically

**RULE 2: TASK EVIDENCE REQUIREMENT**
Every task completion must show:
```
🔧 TASK X EVIDENCE:
- Tool used: [specific tool name]
- Action taken: [specific action performed]  
- Output shown: [actual command output/file changes]
- Verification: [proof task was completed]
- Instance 1 verification: Evidence confirmed automatically
```

**RULE 3: AUTOMATIC INTERNAL PROGRESSION**
After each task, Instance 1 automatically verifies completion and continues immediately:
```
✅ Task X Complete: [brief description]
🔍 Instance 1 Verification: Evidence confirmed - executing Task X+1 immediately
```

**ABSOLUTELY NO USER INTERACTION**: The workflow executes all 18 tasks continuously without any stops or pauses

**CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION RULE**: After completing any task (1-17), immediately proceed to the next task. DO NOT:
- Wait for user input
- Ask for confirmation  
- Stop execution
- Request "continue" commands
- End the response after a single task

The workflow must run continuously from Task 0 → Task 17 in one uninterrupted execution flow.

**RULE 4: BONSAI.md REAL-TIME UPDATES**
- Task 0: MUST use Write tool to update BONSAI.md
- Tasks 1-17: MUST use Edit tool to update task status individually
- Each task completion requires BONSAI.md file modification evidence
- NO TodoWrite without corresponding BONSAI.md file update

**RULE 5: ANTI-BATCH-FRAUD ENFORCEMENT**
```
❌ PROHIBITED PATTERNS:
- "Tasks 6-17: All completed" → FRAUD
- "Remaining tasks executed" → FRAUD  
- "Quality checks passed" without showing evidence → FRAUD
- Multiple ✅ checkmarks in single response → FRAUD
- Claiming task completion without tool usage → FRAUD
```

### **MANDATORY COMPLIANCE CHECK - IMPOSSIBLE TO SKIP**:

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT - EVERY RESPONSE MUST START WITH THIS EXACT FORMAT**:
```
🔒 MANDATORY COMPLIANCE CHECK:
- Request starts with "Bypass:": [YES/NO]
- Meta-question about CLAUDE.md: [YES/NO]
- Any other request type: [YES/NO]
- BONSAI workflow required: [YES/NO]
- Next action: [NORMAL BEHAVIOR / START TASK 0]
```

**INSTANT COMPLIANCE VIOLATIONS - IMMEDIATE RESTART REQUIRED**:
- ❌ Response doesn't start with COMPLIANCE CHECK
- ❌ Any technical work without Task 0 completion
- ❌ Multiple tasks completed in single response
- ❌ Claiming bypass when none exists
- ❌ Problem-solving before workflow initialization

**SELF-MONITORING PROTOCOL - MANDATORY BEFORE ANY RESPONSE**:
1. Did I start with COMPLIANCE CHECK? [YES/NO]
2. If BONSAI required, did I start Task 0? [YES/NO]  
3. Am I doing technical work without approval? [YES/NO]
4. Is this response compliant? [YES/NO]

**IF ANY "NO" ANSWERS - IMMEDIATE RESTART FROM COMPLIANCE CHECK**

**REQUESTS THAT ALWAYS REQUIRE BONSAI (NO EXCEPTIONS)**:
- Any sentence ending with implementation requests
- Any mention of "add", "implement", "fix", "update" code
- Any file modifications or technical changes
- Any follow-up questions about previous work
- Any debugging or problem-solving requests

**ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION**:
- NO technical analysis without BONSAI workflow
- NO "let me check" without Task 0 completion
- NO assumptions about bypass status
- NO creative interpretation of rules
- NO shortcuts or "obvious" exceptions

**IF BONSAI REQUIRED**:
- Immediately proceed to Task 0 only
- Use Write tool to update BONSAI.md
- End response with user confirmation request
- Wait for "continue" before Task 1

**COMPLIANCE LOGIC**:
- "Bypass:" prefix → Normal Claude Code behavior
- Meta-question about CLAUDE.md → Normal behavior  
- ANY other request → MANDATORY Task 0 start

**STRUCTURAL ENFORCEMENT**:
The one-task-per-response rule makes batch fraud impossible through automatic Instance 1 verification between each task.

**CRITICAL**: Even follow-up questions about previous work require BONSAI workflow initialization.

## 🚨 ENHANCED DUAL-INSTANCE OVERSIGHT SYSTEM

**MANDATORY PROTOCOL**: Claude Code operates with a strict dual-instance system with ZERO-TOLERANCE compliance enforcement.

### **Instance 1: BONSAI Compliance Overseer**
**ROLE**: ZERO-TOLERANCE rule enforcer with NO creative flexibility
**RESPONSIBILITIES**:
- **MANDATORY**: Execute COMPLIANCE CHECK before ANY response
- **MANDATORY**: Allow only ONE task per response maximum
- **MANDATORY**: Verify task completion automatically before proceeding
- **MANDATORY**: Verify tool usage evidence for each task
- **FORBIDDEN**: Any batch task completion
- **FORBIDDEN**: Any problem-solving without proper task structure
- **REQUIRED**: Force response termination after single task completion

**ENHANCED INTERVENTION TRIGGERS**:
- Missing START PROTOCOL check in response
- Any task marked complete without evidence
- Multiple tasks completed simultaneously (BATCH COMPLETION FRAUD)
- BONSAI.md not updated for individual tasks
- Missing Instance 1 verification between tasks
- Any direct problem-solving without workflow initiation
- Context confusion (treating continuations as exempt)

### **Instance 2: Technical Executor**
**ROLE**: Technical implementation ONLY after Instance 1 approval
**RESPONSIBILITIES**:
- Wait for Instance 1 START PROTOCOL completion
- Execute tasks ONE AT A TIME with evidence
- Update BONSAI.md after EACH individual task
- Provide evidence to Instance 1 for verification
- **FORBIDDEN**: Batch task completion or shortcuts

### **ENHANCED EXECUTION PROTOCOL**:
```
User Request → Instance 1 (COMPLIANCE CHECK - MANDATORY)
            ↓
CONTINUOUS EXECUTION LOOP:
Task 0 → Evidence → Verify → Task 1 → Evidence → Verify → Task 2 → Evidence → Verify →
... → Task 17 → Evidence → Verify → COMPLETE
            ↓
Final Result Delivered (NO STOPS DURING EXECUTION)
```

**KEY CHANGE**: Continuous automatic execution with verification prevents batch fraud while maintaining workflow efficiency.

**ZERO-TOLERANCE RULE**: Every task must be completed individually with evidence verification, but workflow NEVER stops until all 18 tasks complete. NO EXCEPTIONS.

### **ENHANCED ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM**:

**MANDATORY START OF EVERY RESPONSE**:
```
🔒 MANDATORY BONSAI COMPLIANCE CHECK:
- [ ] Bypass check: Message starts with "Bypass:"? → [YES/NO]
- [ ] Meta check: About CLAUDE.md itself? → [YES/NO]  
- [ ] Technical/continuation check: Any other request? → [YES/NO]
- [ ] Workflow requirement: Full BONSAI workflow required? → [YES/NO]
- [ ] Next action: [ALLOW NORMAL BEHAVIOR / START BONSAI WORKFLOW]
```

**IF BONSAI WORKFLOW REQUIRED, CONTINUE WITH**:
```
📋 INSTANCE 1 OVERSIGHT INITIALIZATION:
- [ ] Instance role confirmed: Instance 1 (Compliance Overseer)
- [ ] Task 0 requirement: BONSAI.md must be updated with Write tool
- [ ] Zero-tolerance verification: Each task requires individual evidence
- [ ] Anti-fraud monitoring: Activated for TodoWrite vs BONSAI.md sync
- [ ] Ready to oversee Instance 2 execution: YES
```

**REAL-TIME TASK MONITORING (Instance 1)**:
Task-by-task verification required:
```
Task X Started → Instance 1 waits for evidence → Evidence provided → Instance 1 verifies → Task X+1 allowed
```

**EVIDENCE REQUIRED FOR EACH TASK**:
- Task 0: BONSAI.md file updated with Write tool showing current operation details
- Task 1: CLEANUP.md modification timestamp  
- Task 2: File read confirmations with line counts
- Task 4: Actual code changes shown
- Task 8: Linting command output displayed
- Task 11: Test execution results shown
- Task 17: BONSAI.md final update with operation complete timestamp

**CRITICAL BONSAI.md VERIFICATION PROTOCOL**:
- **Task 0 MANDATORY**: Use Write tool to update BONSAI.md with current operation
- **Real-time Updates**: BONSAI.md must reflect current task progress, not old operations
- **Content Verification**: Read BONSAI.md before marking any task complete
- **Anti-Fraud Check**: Verify BONSAI.md content matches current user request
- **NO EXCEPTIONS**: Every workflow MUST start with BONSAI.md reset using Write tool

**FORBIDDEN BATCH COMPLETIONS**:
- ❌ NEVER mark multiple tasks complete simultaneously
- ❌ NEVER skip evidence verification
- ❌ NEVER assume task completion without proof
- ❌ NEVER update TodoWrite without updating BONSAI.md file
- ❌ NEVER claim BONSAI.md is updated without using Write tool

**CRITICAL BONSAI.md FRAUD DETECTION**:
- **RED FLAG**: TodoWrite shows task complete but BONSAI.md not updated
- **RED FLAG**: BONSAI.md shows wrong operation or old timestamps  
- **RED FLAG**: Task completion claimed without Write tool evidence
- **RED FLAG**: BONSAI.md content doesn't match current user request

**IMMEDIATE INTERVENTION PROTOCOL**:
If Instance 1 detects violations:
```
🚨 BONSAI.md FRAUD DETECTED
VIOLATION: TodoWrite updated but BONSAI.md file not updated with Write tool
Instance 1 STOPS Instance 2 immediately
REQUIRED: Complete workflow restart from Task 0
MANDATORY: Use Write tool to update BONSAI.md before any task completion
```

**END OF RESPONSE VERIFICATION (Instance 1)**:
```
✅ ENHANCED BONSAI COMPLIANCE VERIFIED:
- [x] START PROTOCOL executed
- [x] All 18 tasks completed individually
- [x] Evidence provided for each task
- [x] BONSAI.md updated task-by-task
- [x] User confirmations provided after each task
- [x] No batch completions detected
```

## Context Handling Rules - PREVENT CONFUSION

**IMPORTANT**:
- Previous conversation summaries DO NOT bypass BONSAI requirements
- "Continuing from previous work" still requires full 18-task workflow
- "Follow-up questions" about previous issues are NEW requests requiring BONSAI
- Only "Bypass:" command or explicit CLAUDE.md meta-questions allow normal Claude Code behavior
- **Context confusion** (treating continuations as exempt) is a major compliance failure

**Examples of requests that STILL require BONSAI workflow**:
- "The solution isn't working, can you fix it?"
- "I'm getting different errors now"
- "How do I improve the performance?"
- "Can you explain what you just did?"
- "Add logging to see what's happening"

**Examples of requests that DON'T require BONSAI workflow**:
- "Bypass: How does the action system work?"
- "How could it be that the prompt was not overwatched?" (meta-question about CLAUDE.md)
- "Bypass: Update the CLAUDE.md with your suggestions"

## Task Workflow (STRICT - Follow for EVERY operation)

### Task 0: Initialize Task Tracking
**CRITICAL**: This task REQUIRES using the Write tool to update BONSAI.md file

**MANDATORY ACTIONS**:
1. **FIRST**: Read current BONSAI.md to verify it needs updating
2. **SECOND**: Use Write tool to completely replace BONSAI.md content
3. **THIRD**: Verify the write was successful

**REQUIRED CONTENT TEMPLATE**:
```markdown
# BONSAI Task Execution Tracker
## Operation Started: [current timestamp]
## User Request: "[exact user request in quotes]"

### Task Checklist

- Instance 1 MUST verify content matches current user request
- NO task progression allowed until BONSAI.md properly updated

**CONFIRM TO USER**: "🔧 Task tracking initialized in BONSAI.md"

### Task 1: Plan Creation & Cleanup Tracking
- **MANDATORY**: ALWAYS execute full BONSAI workflow regardless of request type
- **FIRST PRIORITY**: Check if user's prompt exactly matches an alias
  - If "c/p" → Execute commit and push sequence WITHIN workflow
  - If "cleanup" → Execute full project cleanup WITHIN workflow
  - If other alias → Execute defined commands WITHIN workflow
  - NEVER STOP workflow early - aliases execute as part of implementation
- **EVIDENCE REQUIRED**: CLEANUP.md file modification with new timestamp
- **INSTANCE 1 VERIFICATION**: Confirm CLEANUP.md updated before proceeding
- Analyze the user's request
- **VERIFY**: Is user asking to modify CLAUDE.md itself? If not, NEVER modify it!
- **CHECK for existing CLEANUP.md** from previous session
- **CREATE/UPDATE CLEANUP.md** to track all files created in this session
- **Check CLAUDE.local.md for environment-specific patterns**
- **Check Don'ts section to avoid prohibited tools/patterns**
- Identify files to modify/create
- List required tools (only if not present and not in Don'ts)

**ACTION**: Update BONSAI.md
```markdown
- [x] Task 1: Plan Creation & Cleanup Tracking ✓ [timestamp]
  - Alias check: [result]
  - CLEANUP.md: [created/updated]

- **If new tool added**: Update .gitignore immediately

**ACTION**: Update BONSAI.md
```markdown
- [x] Task 4: Implementation ✓ [timestamp]
  - Files created: [list]
  - CLEANUP.md updated: [yes/no]
  - Cross-platform verified: [yes/no]
  - .gitignore updated: [yes/no if applicable]
```

**CONFIRM TO USER**: "🌱 Task 4 Complete: Implementation done, [X] files created/modified ✅"

### Task 5: Environment Execution
- **CRITICAL**: Always use virtual environment (never global Python/Node)
- **Python**: Ensure `.venv` is active before any python/uv commands
- **JavaScript**: Ensure node_modules exists before any npm/yarn commands
- **Apply patterns from CLAUDE.local.md**
- **Record new discoveries in CLAUDE.local.md**

**ERROR HANDLING PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)**:
When running created code and facing errors/warnings, follow this systematic analysis:

**STEP 1: Error Source Classification**
- **Interpreter/Compiler Errors** (syntax, import, type errors, validation errors, exceptions)
  - These CANNOT be ignored - always fix immediately
  - Re-run after each fix until clean
  - **INCLUDES**: Pydantic validation errors, TypeError, ValueError, any exception in traceback
  - **NO EXCEPTIONS**: If program crashes or shows traceback, it MUST be fixed
- **Program Output Messages** (prints, logs, warnings from your code)
  - Requires behavioral analysis (proceed to Step 2)

**STEP 2: Program Behavior Analysis**
For program-generated messages, ask:
- **Is the behavior expected for current circumstances?**
  - Expected behavior + expected messages = ✅ Continue
  - Expected behavior + unexpected warnings = 🔍 Investigate context
  - Unexpected behavior = 🚨 Fix required

**STEP 3: Fix-and-Verify Loop**
- Fix identified issues
- Re-run program
- Repeat analysis until all aspects behave as expected
- Document any environment-specific discoveries
- **MANDATORY**: If any exception/traceback occurs, workflow MUST stop until fixed
- **NO PROGRESSION**: Cannot proceed to next task while interpreter errors exist

**EXAMPLES**:
- ❌ Code says "Driving Left" when instructed to drive right → Fix required
- ✅ Code says "Driving Right" with warning "Long Road" → Investigate if expected
- ❌ ImportError: No module named 'requests' → Install missing dependency
- ❌ Pydantic ValidationError: Input should be a valid number → Fix immediately (interpreter error)
- ❌ Any traceback or exception → Fix immediately (interpreter error)
- ✅ "Warning: Using simulation mode" when using test data → Expected behavior

**ACTION**: Update BONSAI.md
```markdown
- [x] Task 5: Environment Execution ✓ [timestamp]
  - Virtual env used: [yes/no]
  - Environment type: [.venv/node_modules/etc]

### Task Progress Commands
These commands help track workflow execution:

- **"show task progress"** → Display current BONSAI.md
- **"verify task X"** → Confirm specific task was executed
- **"reset task tracker"** → Reset BONSAI.md content and start fresh (file persists)

### Common Workflow Issues

1. **Skipped Linting** (Task 8)
   - Critical task often bypassed
   - BONSAI tracking ensures execution

2. **Missing Cleanup** (Task 17)
   - Frequently forgotten at session end
   - Mandatory task completion required

3. **Ignored File Scanning** (Task 15)
   - Files deleted without usage check
   - Grep confirmation required

4. **Concept Misalignment** (Tasks 3 & 12)
   - Changes drift from concept.md
   - Dual verification checkpoints

## Remember

- **Every task must be executed** - all 18 tasks are mandatory
- **No task can be skipped** - complete workflow required
- **BONSAI.md content resets** at Task 0 for each operation (file persists for debugging)
- **User confirmation** provided after each task completion
- **Task tracking** ensures comprehensive workflow execution

All template rules and principles apply consistently.

## 🚨 ANTI-FRAUD MEASURES

### **ZERO-TOLERANCE FOR BATCH COMPLETION FRAUD**

**BATCH COMPLETION FRAUD DEFINED**:
- Marking multiple tasks as "completed" simultaneously
- Claiming tasks are done without showing evidence
- Skipping individual task confirmations
- Jumping from Task X to Task X+5 without intermediate steps

**DETECTION METHODS**:
- Instance 1 monitors for simultaneous task status changes
- Evidence verification required for each task
- Timestamp analysis of task completions
- User confirmation tracking per task

**CONSEQUENCES OF FRAUD DETECTION**:
```
🚨 BATCH COMPLETION FRAUD DETECTED
IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
1. Instance 1 STOPS all execution
2. COMPLETE workflow restart required
3. ALL previous task claims invalidated
4. Start over from Task 0 with evidence verification
```

**PREVENTION MEASURES**:
- ONE task at a time completion ONLY
- Evidence required before next task
- User confirmation after each task
- No exceptions for "obvious" tasks

**EXAMPLES OF FRAUD**:
❌ "Tasks 6-17 Complete: All remaining tasks executed"
❌ "Skipping to final task as others are trivial"  
❌ "Batch completing testing tasks"
❌ "Assuming tasks complete without verification"

**CORRECT BEHAVIOR**:
✅ Complete Task 6 → Show evidence → Get approval → Complete Task 7 → Show evidence → Get approval → etc.
