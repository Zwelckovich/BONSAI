# üå± BONSAI - Build Only Necessary Software, Adapt Intelligently (DEBUG VERSION)

> **DEBUG VERSION**: This version includes task confirmations and progress tracking to ensure all workflow steps are executed properly.

**Note**: BONSAI is the name of this development template/methodology, NOT your project name. Your project can be named anything you want!

---

# CLAUDE.md - Dynamic Minimal Development Guide (DEBUG VERSION)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE

**CLAUDE.md is a TEMPLATE - it should NEVER be modified during normal development**

- ‚ùå **NEVER** update CLAUDE.md with project-specific information
- ‚ùå **NEVER** add your project's learnings, status, or configurations here
- ‚ùå **NEVER** modify CLAUDE.md unless explicitly instructed by the user
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** use CLAUDE.local.md for project-specific learnings
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** use concept.md for project vision and decisions
- ‚úÖ **ONLY** update CLAUDE.md when user explicitly says "update CLAUDE.md" or "change the template"

**If you need to document something project-specific**:
- Environment learnings ‚Üí CLAUDE.local.md
- Project decisions ‚Üí concept.md
- Session tracking ‚Üí CLEANUP.md
- User documentation ‚Üí README.md
- **Task tracking ‚Üí BONSAI.md (DEBUG)**

## Quick Reference

### Core Documents
- **concept.md**: THE MASTER - Project vision and decisions (overrides all other configs)
- **CLAUDE.md**: Template for workflow and practices (READ-ONLY - NEVER MODIFY)
- **CLAUDE.local.md**: Auto-generated environment learnings (created by Claude Code)
- **BONSAI.md**: Task execution tracker (DEBUG VERSION ONLY)

### Session Management
- **CLEANUP.md**: Persistent session tracker - Always in .gitignore
- **BONSAI.md**: Task progress tracker - Reset each operation (DEBUG)

### User-Facing Documents  
- **README.md**: Manual for end users of your software
- **.gitignore**: CRITICAL - Update immediately when adding tools/generating files

### Special Cases
- **PROJECT-TRANSFER.md**: Guide for migrating existing projects (user provides path)
- **migration/**: Temporary analysis during project transfers (rarely needed)
- **CLEANUP.md**: Always present (in .gitignore), shows session history
- **BONSAI.md**: Task execution tracker (add to .gitignore for local debugging)
- **Don'ts Section**: User-defined patterns/tools to avoid (check before adding anything)
- **Command Aliases**: User-defined shortcuts - type exactly (e.g., just "c/p" not "please c/p")

## Philosophy & Core Principles

**Main Principle**: Start minimal, grow only when needed. Every addition must be justified by actual project requirements.

**CRITICAL RULE**: Every single user interaction MUST follow the complete 18-task BONSAI workflow. No exceptions. No shortcuts. No direct problem-solving without the workflow.

[Previous philosophy section remains unchanged...]

## Task Workflow (STRICT - Follow for EVERY operation)

### Task 0: Initialize Task Tracking (DEBUG)
**DEBUG ACTION**: Reset BONSAI.md content for new operation (persistent file for debugging)

### Execution Log
```

**CONFIRM TO USER**: "üîß DEBUG: Task tracking initialized in BONSAI.md"

### Task 1: Plan Creation & Cleanup Tracking
- **MANDATORY**: ALWAYS execute full BONSAI workflow regardless of request type
- **FIRST PRIORITY**: Check if user's prompt exactly matches an alias
  - If "c/p" ‚Üí Execute commit and push sequence WITHIN workflow
  - If "cleanup" ‚Üí Execute full project cleanup WITHIN workflow
  - If other alias ‚Üí Execute defined commands WITHIN workflow
  - NEVER STOP workflow early - aliases execute as part of implementation
- Analyze the user's request
- **VERIFY**: Is user asking to modify CLAUDE.md itself? If not, NEVER modify it!
- **CHECK for existing CLEANUP.md** from previous session
- **CREATE/UPDATE CLEANUP.md** to track all files created in this session
- **Check CLAUDE.local.md for environment-specific patterns**
- **Check Don'ts section to avoid prohibited tools/patterns**
- Identify files to modify/create
- List required tools (only if not present and not in Don'ts)

**DEBUG ACTION**: Update BONSAI.md

## Debug Mode Features

### BONSAI.md Structure
The BONSAI.md file tracks task execution and serves as proof that the workflow is being followed:

```markdown
# BONSAI Task Execution Tracker
## Operation Started: 2024-01-15 10:30:45
## User Request: "Add API endpoint for user authentication"

### Task Checklist
- [x] Task 0: Initialize Task Tracking ‚úì 10:30:45
- [x] Task 1: Plan Creation & Cleanup Tracking ‚úì 10:30:50
  - Alias check: No alias matched
  - CLEANUP.md: Created new
  - Files to modify: main.py, models.py
  - Tools needed: None (using stdlib)
- [x] Task 2: File Reading ‚úì 10:31:00
  - Files read: main.py, models.py, concept.md
  - Dependencies found: fastapi, pydantic
  - Structure understood: yes
[... continues for all tasks ...]

### Execution Log
10:30:45 - Started operation
10:30:50 - Plan created, no aliases matched
10:31:00 - Read 3 files successfully
[... continues with timestamps ...]
10:35:30 - Operation complete

## Operation Complete: 10:35:30
## Total Duration: 5 minutes
## Result: SUCCESS ‚úì
```

### Debug Commands
When in debug mode, these commands help track execution:

- **"show task progress"** ‚Üí Display current BONSAI.md
- **"verify task X"** ‚Üí Confirm specific task was executed
- **"reset debug"** ‚Üí Reset BONSAI.md content and start fresh (file persists)

### Common Issues Caught by Debug Mode

1. **Skipped Linting** (Task 8)
   - Often rushed through or skipped entirely
   - Debug mode forces confirmation

2. **Missing Cleanup** (Task 17)
   - Frequently forgotten at session end
   - Debug mode makes it mandatory

3. **Ignored File Scanning** (Task 15)
   - Files deleted without usage check
   - Debug mode requires grep confirmation

4. **Concept Misalignment** (Tasks 3 & 12)
   - Changes drift from concept.md
   - Debug mode verifies twice

### Transitioning from Debug Mode

Once confident that Claude Code follows the workflow:
1. Switch back to regular CLAUDE.md
2. Keep BONSAI.md for complex operations
3. Use debug mode for troubleshooting

## Remember (DEBUG VERSION)

- **Every task must be confirmed** in BONSAI.md
- **No task can be skipped** - all 18 must execute
- **BONSAI.md content resets** at Task 0 for each operation (file persists for debugging)
- **User sees confirmations** after each task
- **Debug mode is temporary** - use until workflow is reliable

All other rules from the original CLAUDE.md apply.

---

*DEBUG NOTE: This version adds approximately 30 seconds to operations due to confirmation messages and file updates. Use regular CLAUDE.md once confident in task execution.*
