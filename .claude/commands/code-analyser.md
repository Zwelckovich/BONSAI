Bypass: [TASK] Analyze codebase for dead code and quality issues. Find all code files (.py, .js, .ts, .html, .css, .jsx, .tsx) excluding docs (.md, .pdf, .txt). Also exclude virtual environments (venv, .venv, etc.). Create CODECHECK.md with file list. For each file, analyze and document: unused functions (defined but never called), empty/stub functions, dead code (unreachable/obsolete logic), unused imports/variables. Update CODECHECK.md after each file to track progress across context compactions. Cross-reference function usage across entire codebase before flagging as unused. Write final summary with actionable recommendations. RULES: Only modify CODECHECK.md (read-only analysis of source files). Ultrathink!
