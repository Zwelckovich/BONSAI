Plan phase $ARGUMENTS by using the prompt of the phase of @GROW.md and if the plan is accepted by me start the GROW! BONSAI process for this phase. At the end update @GROW.md regarding the process. Also create a example for this phase in the @dev_examples/ like the others. In the Update Documentation Task also check for inconsistent entry like not updated Phases etc. and also update @GROW_CROSSWALK.md. When the plan is accepted by me start the GROW! process with the complete BONSAI workflow included! Ultrathink!
