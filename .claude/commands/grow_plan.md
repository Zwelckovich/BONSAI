Plan phase $ARGUMENTS by using the prompt of the phase of @GROW.md and if the plan is accepted by me start the GROW! BONSAI process for this phase. At the end update @GROW.md regarding the process. Also create a example for this phase in the @dev_examples/ like the others. At the end also update the @user_examples/minimal_sweep_level2.py and implement a DSL free solution of the feature in @user_examples/minimal_sweep_level1.py, keep them minimal and clean like now (without prints or other unnecessary stuff). In the Update Documentation Task also check for inconsistent entry like not updated Phases etc. and also update @GROW_CROSSWALK.md. When the plan is accepted by me start the GROW! process with the complete BONSAI workflow included! Ultrathink!
